Current limitations of Libpskc:

* No functions to set fields, only to read them.

* The EncryptionKey and MACMethod types are not supported.

* Only PlainValue data fields are supported (i.e., EncryptedValue and
  ValueMAC fields are not supported).

* No extensions are implemented.

Otherwise Libpskc is believed to be a complete PSKC implementation
conforming to the PSKC standard RFC 6030, including the following
features:

* Parse PSKC data and print human readable information.

* Validate PSKC data against XML Schema.

* Sign and verify PSKC data using XML Digital Signatures.
